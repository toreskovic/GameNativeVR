# GameNative VR

**A fork of GameNative with experimental performance and compatibility improvements for playing PCVR games on standalone VR headsets (Quest 2 / 3, Pico 4)**

</div>

## Differences to GameNative

- **Support for the Pico 4 headset** (via a patched Turnip driver)
- Native display resolution querying. By comparison, vanilla GameNative queries the OpenXR runtime for a "recommended resolution" which is lower than the actual display resolution. One caveat tho, we are still applying the aspect ratio that the OpenXR runtime returns.
- SGSR (Snapdragon Game Super Resolution). A better alternative to FSR for mobile / VR hardware. Foveated for squeezing out a bit more performance
- Experimental fixed foveated rendering injected in any game (in practice it's more than a bit janky but works in Beat Saber)
- Game compatibility fixes (Clone Drone in the Hyperdome anyone?)
- A toggle to disable MSAA in DX11 games (some games don't expose a setting and MSAA is expensive)
- FOV scale so you can literally cut corners for performance gain
- sensible default config that should work out of the box for most games (at least the ones I tried)

All new features are configurable under the graphics tab in the container settings

## Anecdotal Performance / Compatibility Notes

**All testing was done on a Pico 4 using the Pico metrics overlay. It unfortunately reports the android present FPS instead of the actual game FPS. Resolutions are approximate since this fork is applying a bit of an aspect ratio so in practice it's not a square**

**Beat Saber (all graphics settings low or off)**: vanilla GameNative needed 60% resolution scaling (1296x1296 per eye) to get stable 72 FPS. With fixed foveated rendering, it goes to 85% (1836x1836) with SGSR or 90% (1944x1944) without SGSR while still at a stable 72 FPS. Lowering the FOV gets it to 100% resolution at 72 FPS.

**Clone Drone in the Hyperdome**: didn't run on vanilla GameNative. Early tests without foveation in this fork ran at about 35-40 FPS at 65% resolution scaling with SGSR (I'm assuming vanilla GameNative would perform similarly). Forcing MSAA off gets it to 65-72 at the same resolution. FFR doesn't seem to help much for some reason but reducing FOV can get it further.

**SUPERHOT VR**: now playable

## Development Notice

LLMs were used extensively in developing this fork. I'm treating it all as a quick 'n' dirty proof of concept to see what's possible and tailoring it to my own use cases. Expect buggy and sporadic releases and zero support.

**If you wish to contribute, the best way to do so is to take concepts / features from this fork, implement them more properly, and submit them as PRs for vanilla GameNative. Credit / mention is welcome but not needed since I didn't write the bulk of the code myself.**

GameNative lets you run the PC games in your Steam, Epic and GOG libraries directly on Android — no streaming required. Your saves sync to the cloud, so you can stop on your PC and keep going on your phone.

It's still early. Not every game runs yet, and some need tweaking to play well, but the community is constantly finding and sharing configs that work — and these get applied automatically. You can see if anyone has tried running your game successfully at https://gamenative.app/compatibility.

## What you get

- Play games you actually own on Steam, Epic, GOG and Amazon
- Cloud saves that carry over between your PC and your phone
- Automatically applied known configs, so many games just work out of the box with no tweaking required
- Controller and touch support, with a custom control editor and on-screen HUD
- Steam DLC, workshop and branch support
- Active support over Discord if you need help getting a game running

## Demo

## How to use

1. Download the latest release [here](https://downloads.gamenative.app/releases//gamenative-v.apk)
2. Install the APK on your Android device
3. Log in to your Steam account
4. Install your game
5. Hit play and enjoy

## Support

The fastest way to get help is the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2hKv4VfZfE) — we're 35k+ strong and someone's usually around.

Please **don't** open issues on GitHub; they're closed automatically. Bring it to Discord instead.

If you'd like to chip in, you can support the project on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/gamenative).

## Contributing

Want to help out? Message us to get into the **#development** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2hKv4VfZfE), or open a thread there. Things we're currently looking for help with live on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vGRkFoAM/open-source-board).

### Building

Most of the time you don't need this — if you just want to play, grab the release above. This is for contributors.

1. Build it like any normal Android Studio project. Ask on Discord if you get stuck.
2. **SteamGridDB API key (optional):** to pull game artwork for custom games, add your key to `local.properties`:
   ```properties
   STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   You can get one from your [SteamGridDB preferences](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences). Without it everything still works — it just won't fetch images.

## Analytics & privacy

GameNative uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for anonymous analytics. No personal information is ever collected — no names, emails, IPs or device identifiers.

**Always collected**, to improve game compatibility:
- Game launch, close and exit events (game name, store, session length, average FPS, container config)
- Game install, cancel and uninstall events

This is how we figure out which games work, how well they run, and which configs to apply automatically for the next person. It can't identify you.

**Optional**, and switchable under *Settings → Info → Usage Analytics*:
- Feature usage (on-screen keyboard, controller, HUD, control editor)
- Login success/failure events
- Recommendation interactions
- App lifecycle events (foreground/background)
- Cloud sync events

The full [Privacy Policy](PrivacyPolicy/README.md) has the details.
